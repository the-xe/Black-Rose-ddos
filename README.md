# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/black-rose.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd black-rose

# Install the required dependencies

## 🧪 Usage

From the command line:

```bash
# Launch an attack with custom parameters
python black_rose.py --target https://example.com --duration 600
```

Or programmatically (by importing its modules, if designed for it):
```python
# This is a conceptual example if you structure it as a library
from black_rose import AttackOrchestrator

config = {"target": "https://example.com", "duration": 30, "threads": 100}
orchestrator = AttackOrchestrator(config)
orchestrator.unleash_vengeance()
```
